Scenario:

Suppose you are working on a e-commerce company that has multiple stores around the world, 
they want to have a dashboard to know what are the most selling products by country, 
the company has different files on CSV and JSON every day about the product's data such as the product name, cost,
and how many has been sold on each country. Tell me how would you design an end to end ETL or ELT pipeline for that scenario.

Following questions:

- The company decides to store data regarding the state location of the clients that buy the product,
this data is stored on MongoDB and DynamoDB depending the country, 
how would you introduce that data on the pipeline to be considered on the dashboards such as, 
from the most selling product what are the top 3 client's states that buy the product by country.



- While loading the data from the products and the state location of the clients that buy the product, 
you encounter there are products that the client bought but were not listed on the original products, how would you troubleshoot that?



- How can you implement the scenario on cloud?



- Design the datawarehouse tables of your solution



- From your solution query the 5 products with most sells for all the world



- From your solution query the 5 products with most sells by country
