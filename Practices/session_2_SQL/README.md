## Practice

You're working on a clinic, and the clinic needs a database to have records of the appointments that were made between the patient and the doctor.

The clinic only provides you a CSV file with the historical data of the appointments and they ask you to create the database from it.

## Requirements

* Develop and setup a docker container of a Relational Database by using the provided [CSV](clinic.csv) file's data

## Let's do it

### Step 1

First, we are going to create a docker container with a MySQL image to create a clinic Database

Create within this folder a dockerfile with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM mysql
ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword
ENV MYSQL_DATABASE=mydatabase
ENV MYSQL_USER=myuser
ENV MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
EXPOSE 3306
```

#### Dockerfile

> A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. A Dockerfile is used to create an image, which can then be used to create new containers. A Dockerfile typically includes instructions for setting environment variables, copying files, and running commands.

Now build a docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t clinic .
```

This command builds a docker image with name as **´clinic´** by using the **´-t´** flag.

Now you can see the images on your docker with following command:

```bash
docker images
```

#### Docker Image

**A Docker image is a pre-built package that contains all the necessary files and dependencies to run an application or service. You can think of an image as a snapshot of an application or service that can be used to create new containers.**

You can find and download images from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search), which is a public registry of Docker images. You can also create your own images by writing a Dockerfile, which is a script that contains instructions for building an image.

Now let's create a container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 6603:3306 --name clinic-container clinic
```

This command will create a docker container named as **´clinic-container´** from **´clinic´** image.

* The **´-d´** option runs the container in detached mode, which allows it to run in the background.
* The **-p** flag helps to publish Publish container's port(s) to the host, in this case `<host-port>:<container-port>`
* The **--rm** flag instructs Docker to also remove the anonymous volumes associated with the container if the container is removed

#### Docker Container

**A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. When you start a container, Docker creates a new, isolated environment for the application or service to run in. Containers are lightweight and efficient, and you can run multiple containers on the same host.**

![img](documentation_images/docker-registry.png)

#### Docker commands

List of common docker commands:

* **docker run** : Runs a new container from an image
* **docker ps** : Lists all running containers
* **docker stop** : Stops a running container
* **docker start** : Starts a stopped container
* **docker logs** : Shows the log output of a container
* **docker build** : Builds an image from a Dockerfile
* **docker pull** : Pulls an image or a repository from the registry
* **docker rm** : Remove one or more containers
* **docker image rm**: Remove one or more images

### Docker VS Virtual Machine

Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that allow you to run applications in isolation from the host system. Containers are built on top of the host operating system and share the host's kernel. They are lightweight because they don't include an operating system, but instead rely on the host's kernel to provide the necessary services.

Virtual machines (VMs) are software-based systems that mimic the hardware of a physical computer. They run on top of a hypervisor, which is a software layer that sits between the VM and the host operating system. VMs are typically used to run multiple operating systems on the same host, each in its own isolated environment.

### Step 2

Now let's create a sample **´clinic_db´** within the mysql database.

First, let's connect to the docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it clinic-container bash
```

This command will connect to **´clinic_container´** on a bash console.

Now within docker container, with following command will connect to mysql instance:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

This command will ask you for a password and type: **mypassword**

Now let's create **´clinic_db´** on mysql with the following command:

```bash
create database clinic_db;
```

This command will create the database **´clinic_db´**

### Step 3

Following up, let's connect to the database by using a Database client, on this case with DBeaver.

First let's open [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) IDE and click on the New Database Connection Icon that is on the upper left of the IDE:

![img](documentation_images/dbeaver-1.png)

Then a pop up window will open and here selects **´MySQL´** option and click on **Next**

![img](documentation_images/dbeaver-2.png)

Then on connection parameters use the following:

* Server Host: **localhost**
* Port: **6603**
* Database: **clinic_db**
* Username: **root**
* Password: **mypassword**

![img](documentation_images/dbeaver-3.png)

Then on Driver Properties tab on **´allowPublicKeyRetrieval´** set is as **´true´**

![img](documentation_images/dbeaver-4.png)

Now click on Test connection and should appear as **´Connected´**

![img](documentation_images/dbeaver-5.png)

### Step 4

Now let's check the CSV file data and create an initial definition of the database

In this case the provided [CSV](clinic.csv) file contains the following data:

```CSV
patient_name,patient_last_name,patient_address,appointment_date,appointment_time,doctor_name,doctor_last_name,doctor_clinical_specialization
John,Doe,123 Main St,2022-01-01,10:00 AM,Jane,Smith,Pediatrics
Jane,Smith,456 Park Ave,2022-01-02,11:00 AM,Michael,Johnson,Family Medicine
Michael,Johnson,789 Elm St,2022-01-03,12:00 PM,Emily,Williams,Cardiology
Emily,Williams,321 Oak St,2022-01-04,1:00 PM,Matthew,Brown,Cardiology
Matthew,Brown,654 Pine St,2022-01-05,2:00 PM,Abigail,Jones,Dermatology
Abigail,Jones,987 Cedar St,2022-01-06,3:00 PM,Daniel,Miller,Orthopedics
```

On this case there are the following columns:

patient_name | patient_last_name | patient_address | appointment_date | appointment_time | doctor_name | doctor_last_name | doctor_clinical_specialization
--- |-------------------| --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |---
String | String            | String | Date | Time | String | String | String

Now let's create a database table definition for this data:

```SQL
create table clinic_raw (
    patient_name varchar(100),
    patient_last_name varchar(100),
    patient_address varchar(200),
    appointment_date varchar(50),
    appointment_time varchar(50),
    doctor_name varchar(100),
    doctor_last_name varchar(100), 
    doctor_clinical_specialization varchar(100)
);
```

To execute it on database, you can open dbeaver and execute it on a SQL Script tab:

![img](documentation_images/dbeaver-6.png)

### Step 5

Now let's load CSV data into the raw table.

First copy csv file from local to the container with the following command:

```bash
docker cp clinic.csv clinic-container:/tmp/clinic.csv
```

This command will copy local host **´clinic.csv´** file to clinic-container's **´/tmp/clinic.csv´**

Now let's connect to clinic_db with the command:

```bash
docker exec -it clinic-container mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
```

This command will connect to mysql db from the docker's **´clinic-container´** that we ran before.
> The mysql command option **´--local-infile=1´** will allow to import local files while executing SQL statements

Once on mysql prompt, let's set a global variable that will allow us to use local files from SQL statements by using the following command:

```SQL
SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;
```

Then switch to **´clinic_db´** with the following command:

```SQL
USE clinic_db;
```

Once there, we can import CSV data to **´clinic_raw´** table with the following command:

```SQL
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/tmp/clinic.csv"
INTO TABLE clinic_raw
COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
ESCAPED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

Now let's verify all csv data is present by using the following SQL statements:

```SQL
select * from clinic_raw;
```

## Conclusion

Docker is a powerful tool that makes it easy to run and manage databases like MySQL. By following this practice, you should now have a solid understanding of how to use Docker to run and manage a MySQL container. Remember that Docker is just one of many tools you can use to manage your databases, and that you should always choose the right tool for the job.

I hope this guide was helpful in your understanding of using Docker with MySQL. You are now equipped with the knowledge to deploy and manage your MySQL databases using Docker. Happy coding!
