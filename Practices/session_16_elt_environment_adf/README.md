## ETL VS ELT

In general the advantages of ETL are the advantages of ELT

|Feature|ETL| ELT|
|-|-|-|
|Transformations|Non-sql code dedicated stage|Limited to SQL after insert or during query execution|
|Data Quality|Done during transformation, inserted data is clean|Limited to table constraints, data inserted is raw|
|Integration with Other Systems|Requires manual integration, but support what you can code|Limited to Database connectors|
|Pipeline time|Slow: information not available until transformation is done|Real time/near real time: pipeline work as a bridge|
|Scalability|Harder to manage as input increases|Only need more space in the destiny database|
|Costs|Processing|Storage (and processing when doing complex querys)|

>Since ETL performs the transformations during pipeline this means data may not be available ASAP, also it requires additional resources such as intermediate data structures that can increase the complexity of the pipeline, however well managed these structures can be refined to make efficient datamarts in the same step and increase data quality.
>
>ELT on the other side will only do simple transformations, but will give you the data ASAP. It's worth notice that ELT may look like never do the transformation part, but it performs the transformation after being stored or during execution time.

## Practice

A credit rating agency needs daily stock market data in a queryable structure. Prepare the infrastructure on Azure Cloud and create an Azure Data Factory with all linked services ready to be consumed.

### Requirements

* Create the following Azure Cloud resources:
  * Resource Group
  * Resource Providers
  * SQL Server Datawarehouse Instance
    * Storage account with sample csv given
    * SQL DW connection
    * Azure data factory
  * SQL Server Instance
    * Storage account for datawarehouse
    * SQL DB connection
  * Connect those with SSMS/Azure Data Studio
* Create on Azure Data Studio the following linked services:
  * to both Storage account
  * to customer API `https://data.nasdaq.com`
  * to Azure SQL database
  * to Snowflake

Follow the naming convention and abbreviations suggested by microsoft:

* [Azure Naming convention][azure_naming]
* [Azure Resource abbreviations][azure_abbreviations]

### Step 0 - Azure Portal

* Go to [Azure Portal][azure_portal]
* Then login
  ![img](./img/azure-portal/home.png)

>You might get a prompt for a tour if this is your first time login, otherwise your view is something similar to the above

### Step 1 - Resources

>When creating resources you need to mantain consistency (this will be helpful in large orgs when multiple projects are active at the same time), this is similar to a library, you get sections, authors, in this case we can imagine a project ("de-101") and based on that we know if we found a drive labeled, user, container... it belongs to that project, but also we ensure if we search globally we can get all related resources (this works for deleting/deprecating areas too) \
>The consistency can be achieved via `Tags`, however for most of the users tags can be not that visual/easy/quick to work with

In this practice we will follow the convention `<Resource Type>-<Workload/Application>`

#### Step 1.1 - Resource Group

>A resource group is a logical container that holds related Azure resources such as virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, virtual networks... \
>If Azure was a library, a resource group will be the sections

* Go to `Resource groups`
  ![img](./img/azure-portal/rg.png)
* Click `+ Create`
  * Subscription: Default \
    *Is very likely you have only 1 subscription (free), but if you have more than 1 ensure the subscription is consistent accross the steps*
    * Resource Group: `rg-de101`
  * Region: `(US) South Central US` \
    *You can pick any region as long as all resources will be in that same region, recommended any region close to you*
* Use all other defaults

![img](./img/create/rg.png)

#### Step 1.2 - Resource Providers

>Resource providers enable the provisioning, management, and maintenance of Azure resources or services, such as virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, networking... these are linked to a subscription (AKA: Money provider) that tells the provider what can and can't provide and to what limits \
>Following the if Azure was a library, a Resource provider will be the librarian and the subscription will be the librarian contract

* Go to `Subscriptions`
  * Click your subscription
    ![img](./img/azure-portal/sub.png)
* On the left panel search/scroll
  * Click `Resource Providers`
    ![img](./img/azure-portal/rp.png)
* On the center panel search/scroll
  * Click `Synapse`
    ![img](./img/azure-portal/synapse.png)
* Click `Register` at the top of the center panel
  ![img](./img/synapse/register.png)

The image will change from these states (we want `registered`)
![img](./img/synapse/not-registered.png)![img](./img/synapse/registering.png)![img](./img/synapse/registered.png)

#### Step 1.3 - Blob Storage Account

>Blob Storage Account is the cloud storage for azure, it allows you to store images, logs. videos, backups... These also contains small subunits Containers (Storage would be an equivalent to a drive and Container to folders) \
>Following the if Azure was a library, Storage would be the shelves and Containers the section dividers (A, B, C...)

* Go to `Storage accounts`
  ![img](./img/azure-portal/storage.png)
* Click `+ Create`
  * Subscription: Default
    * Resource Group: `rg-de101`
  * Storage account name: `stde101` \
    *In this resource name we cannot use '-' so we omit it*
  * Region: `(US) South Central US`
  * Performance: `Standard`
  * Redundancy: `Locally-redundant storage (LRS)`
* Use all other defaults \
  Once the provider is done, you should be able to see a screen like this
  ![img](./img/create/storage.png)
* Click `Go to resource`
  ![img](./img/create/storage-goto.png)
  *Alternatively you can Go to `Storage accounts` and click on the created resource*
  ![img](./img/create/storage-2.png)
* On the left panel search/scroll
  * Click `Containers`
    ![img](./img/azure-portal/containers.png)
* Click `+ Container`
  * Name: `c-de101-data` \
    *You can use any name, this is an internal container name, however we will follow the name convention for consistency*
  * Use all other defaults
  ![img](./img/create/container.png)
* Click your container
* Click Upload
  ![img](./img/container/upload.png)
* Upload `./practice_files/aapl.csv`
  ![img](./img/container/upload-aapl.gif)

The file should now be listed in the container
![img](./img/container/upload-aapl-2.png)

#### Step 1.3 - Data Lake Storage

>This may look like the Storage we create earlier, the difference is how the data is treated, in this case we will enable `Data Lake Storage`
>

## Still curious

### ELT Basics

>ELT (Extraction Load Transform) is a data process method where the data is inserted raw or almost raw into the final destination.

* Why should we consider having raw data in our datawarehouse instead of a normalized tailored data?

  Unlike ETL, where we spend some time normalizing and enriching data, this in some cases is not sustainable:
    >As the volume and data complexity increases the time spent executing and mantaining an ETL increases too

  ELT can help us on this topic, since we can process the data faster, but this also means we can split the data load without breaking constraints enabling even faster processing speeds.

* But we still have a problem, the data is still raw and is complex to query

  The data obtained after ELT it's raw, however nowadays we have tools to manage data catalogs and metadata managers. \
  This essentially means the data is not just an unformatted raw file, but instead an structure we can query

* Ok we can query the data, but that doesn't mean is good data (Quality check)

  With today tools we can enable check at various stages of the ELT pipeline to ensure that data meets specific criteria, such as completeness, consistency, and accuracy. Monitoring can be used to track data quality over time and identify trends and issues.

* We can add on top of it

  Machine Learning and AI can be used to identify patterns, reducing the need for manual intervention; also recommend remediation steps in case of data quality issues prediction.

#### ELT pipelines tools

These are some of the tools you can use to mount your ETL process

* Apache Airflow \
  An open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows
* Talend \
  A data integration and management tool that supports ELT workflows
* AWS Glue \
  A fully managed ETL service that supports both ETL and ELT workflows in the cloud
* Microsoft Azure Data Factory \
  A cloud-based data integration service that supports both ETL and ELT workflows
* Google Cloud Dataflow \
  A cloud-based data processing service that supports both batch and stream processing, including ELT workflows.

### ETL Basics

We already have a lesson on this topic on: [session 5][session_5]

### ELT + ELT = ETLT?

As a tendency in the last years and as companies have more and more data, they slowly start to transition ETL into ELT pipelines, however other engineers are doing hybrid ETL/ELT:

ETL part is used to handle complex transformations and data quality checks while the ELT part takes care of the after insert less complex transformations since the SQL engine can run queries faster than custom datasets by code such as python.

Another problem this approach can solve is to address different issues within the same organization

    Ex. Sales department requires data in real time, while the marketing team requires complex transformations for reports at the end of each shift.

>There's nothing written use the tools available to solve the problem and combine technologies in a way that's logical to avoid future problems
